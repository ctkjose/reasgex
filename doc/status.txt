Testing URL: http://localhost/reasgex/app/test/employee/do/?a=joe

Basic GUI done. Took a break to work on the backend to be able to work on the JS controller, datasets, datasources, etc.

We have a basic structure to call the backend. The backend is implementes by "controllers".

All interactions is with "app.php".

This php is responsible to load controllers and execute the behaviors.

---------------

Work on UI
Testing URL: http://localhost/reasgex/test/test_ui_core001.html

Implemented "components" to be able to add functionality.

UI widgets are implemented as "components".

UI elements are build from semantical html and shorthands.
