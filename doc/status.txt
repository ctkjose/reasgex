Testing URL: http://localhost/reasgex/app/test/employee/do/?a=joe

Basic GUI done. Took a break to work on the backend to be able to work on the JS controller, datasets, datasources, etc.

We have a basic structure to call the backend. The backend is implementes by "controllers".

All interactions is with "app.php".

This php is responsible to load controllers and execute the behaviors.

---------------

Work on UI
Testing URL: http://localhost/reasgex/test/test_ui_core001.html

Implemented "components" to be able to add functionality.

UI widgets are implemented as "components".

UI elements are build from semantical html and shorthands.

Started defined common behaviors and patterns for ui and components design.

Working with basic implementation of DataSource Controller
